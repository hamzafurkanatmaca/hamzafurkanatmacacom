	<p>
		I'm Hamza Furkan Atmaca — a Computer Engineer with a master's degree (with thesis) from
		Yıldız Technical University. I work as a .NET backend developer building resilient APIs,
		background services, and event-driven systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		Lately, I'm exploring AI and prompt engineering: integrating LLMs into backend workflows,
		orchestrating tools, and experimenting with retrieval, evaluation, and prompt design to
		improve developer productivity.
	</p>

	<p>
		On this site I write about .NET, clean architecture, DDD, cloud-native patterns, testing,
		and practical AI for backend engineers. I’ll also share notes from my research, learnings,
		and side projects.
